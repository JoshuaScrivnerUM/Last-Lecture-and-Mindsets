Assignments on Mindsets


THE LAST LECTURE
The thing that affected me the most about this video was just the amount of life lessons Randy had to share. One of my favorites was, 
“Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress you.”
I feel like this will stick with as it stuck with him. It really conveys the message that not everyone goes the same pace and that’s okay. Not only this but giving others a chance can really, as he said surprise and impress you. I like comparing this to an Esports team and the idea that not everyone will be at the same skill level. Despite everyone being at varying skill levels once the people who seem to be underperforming are given a chance they will likely be the same ones to shock and impress you. 
Another thing that caught my attention in the video was when he discussed the VR game project he worked on with students. This was a very fun part of the video. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the bunny cheer as the gamer motioned her hands upward and the world slowly formed. I also enjoyed the part when she was done with the game and the bunny became displeased and refused to just let her shut it all down. Definitely was a highlight of the whole video.
The message I probably wasn’t too keen on was,
		“Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.”
I am just not sure if I entirely agree with that statement. I like to believe that an experience is something you put a value on. Sure maybe it was not something you wanted but it was something you learned from.
Overall I thought the video was okay. However it was probably one of the best lectures I’ve seen, despite me not usually being too fond of lectures.

MIND-SETS
Before this assignment I was not aware of what a mindset was. After reading and taking the quiz though I was somewhat shocked by my results. After taking the quiz I got agreed with four of the fixed mindset questions and agreed with four of the growth mindset questions. This was shocking to me since it was sort of a fifty-fifty. 
I absolutely have a different perspective on mindsets now. My Dad always told me growing up that I should be careful about what I think and say because if I say it enough it might come true. The mindsets kinda went hand and hand with that for me. For example if you think you are not good at something you most likely will convince yourself that you’re not good at that said thing.
I do think this will affect my outlook moving forward. I am definitely going to be more aware of when I beat myself down and try to get back into a growth mindset. Keep my mind in the sense of knowing I can do something rather than telling myself I can’t.
Overall I did really enjoy reading about mindsets it really opened my eyes to how powerful a growth mindset can be.
